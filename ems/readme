Before deploying:

1. Please create a database 'emp' and import the 'localhost.sql' present in 'ems/database' directory.
	 Database configurations are saved in db_connection.php

	 If you need to use your own email id (should be gmail) then  make sure to turn on "Allow less secure apps in Gmail" by 
	 visiting the following links :

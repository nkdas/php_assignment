Before deploying:

1. Please create a database 'emp' and import the 'localhost.sql' present in 'ems/database' directory.
Database configurations are saved in db_connection.php

2. This app sends an activation link through email, I have used Gmail and have provided the login credentials.
If you need to use your own email id (should be gmail) then  make sure to turn on "Allow less secure apps in Gmail" by visiting the following links :

and provide your credentials (email id and password) in mail.php
